had to use qemu-arm

had to install gdb-multiarch

used command:
    qemu-arm -L /usr/arm-linux-gnueabihf/ -g 1234 serverfarm

used command:
    gdb-multiarch -q -nx

gdb command:
    file serverfarm
    set architecture arm
    target remote localhost:1234 AAAA

knowing it will fail when the comparison of r2 > r3 is not true
we can modify the value of r2 to ensure that it progresses to the next block

if the comparison is true, usually done by setting r2 to a value higher than r3 everytime,
I can progress to the next block.

afterwards I watch for when comparisons are done with my input to values predetermined within the program.

comparisons to 0x23, 0x41, an 0x0 are made at crucial points

when it is correctly compared you get a chunk of the flag at a time.

I didn't really understand everything that was happening but I was able to understand at what points to progress and how to make the
program progress into the direction I wanted while giving it "correct" inputs.

flag = IW{S.E.R.V.E.R>=F:A:R:M}
